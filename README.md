# Applied LLM Projects

A portfolio of production-minded AI engineering projects built with modern tooling including RAG, LangGraph, LangChain, Ollama, and observability platforms like LangSmith.

Each project showcases a different aspect of applied large language model (LLM) development.

All models run locally through Ollama — no API keys or cloud costs required.
